    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Curry has always been a passion of mine, especially Japanese Curry. After
      years of searching I have discovered the perfect Japanese Curry. Many of
      these spices can be found at your local Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern
      markets, or substituted with S&B® Oriental Curry Powder. Well worth the
      effort - your family will love this! Serve over steamed rice or noodles.
