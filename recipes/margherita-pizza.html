    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 (14-1/2 ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
      <li>6 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>10 leaf basil leaves, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread each sheet
          of puff pastry onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper. Use a
          rolling pin to roll pastry into even rectangles. Lift pastry (with
          parchment paper) onto baking sheets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pierce puff pastry all over with a fork. Beat egg with water in a
          small dish; brush pastry all over with egg wash.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, pulse tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil, garlic, and
          a pinch of salt together in a food processor until pureed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Carefully press pastry crusts down to deflate them. Spread half the
          tomato sauce evenly to within about an inch of edges of each crust;
          drizzle with remaining olive oil. Top evenly with mozzarella cheese
          and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake until cheese is melted and crust edges are golden, about 5
          minutes more. Remove from the oven and scatter basil leaves over the
          top. Slice and serve hot.
